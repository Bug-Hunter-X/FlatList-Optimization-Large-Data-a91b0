# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue
This repository demonstrates a bug and its solution related to rendering issues in React Native's FlatList component when dealing with large datasets.  The bug manifests as missing or incorrectly rendered items when scrolling quickly.  The solution involves optimizing data updates and rendering to improve performance and prevent visual glitches.

## Bug Description
The FlatList component, when presented with a large dataset, struggles to keep up with rapid scrolling.  Items may disappear or render incorrectly, leaving the user with a broken visual experience.  This is often due to the internal recycling mechanism of FlatList, which struggles to accurately update items if data changes are occurring at a faster rate than the component can render.
